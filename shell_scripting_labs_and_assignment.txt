# Linux Shell Scripting – Part 1 Labs & Assignments

##  Objective
Learn the basics of shell scripting: variables, input/output, conditionals, exit status, and automation.

---

##  Why Shell Scripting?
Shell scripting automates repetitive Linux tasks. Instead of typing multiple commands manually, scripts allow you to write once and execute anytime.

**Advantages:**
- Saves time
- Reduces human errors
- Enables automation and scheduling (cron jobs)
- Portable across systems

---

## Basic Structure of a Shell Script

Every script starts with a **shebang** line:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

---

## Variables, Input & Output

### Example: Using Variables
```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="Rashi"
echo "Hello $name, welcome to Linux scripting!"
```

### Example: Taking Input
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your name:"
read username
echo "Hello $username!"
```

---

##  Conditionals (if, else, elif)

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

if [ $num -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "Number is greater than 10"
elif [ $num -eq 10 ]; then
    echo "Number is equal to 10"
else
    echo "Number is less than 10"
fi
```

---

## Exit Status

Each command returns an exit code (`$?`):
- 0 → success
- Non-zero → failure

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
ls /tmp
echo "Exit status: $?"
ls /notexist
echo "Exit status: $?"
```

---

## Command Substitution

Use `$(command)` to capture output inside echo statements.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo "Uptime: $(uptime -p)"
echo "Disk Usage:"
df -h | head -n 5
```

##  LAB EXERCISES

###  **Lab 1: Hello Script**
Create `hello.sh` that prints your name, date, and system uptime.

###  **Lab 2: User Input**
Write a script that asks for a filename and checks if it exists.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter filename:"
read file
if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "File exists!"
else
    echo "File not found!"
fi
```

###  **Lab 3: Simple Calculator**
Ask user for two numbers and add them.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter first number: " a
read -p "Enter second number: " b
sum=$((a+b))
echo "Sum is: $sum"
```

###  **Lab 4: System Information Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "===== System Information ====="
echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo "Uptime: $(uptime -p)"
echo ""
echo "Disk Usage:"
df -h | head -n 5
```

---

##  **Assignment 5: Backup Automation**
Write a shell script that:
1. Takes a folder name as input  
2. Compresses it using `tar -czf`  
3. Moves it to `/tmp/backups`  
4. Prints success or failure message depending on the exit status.

**Hint:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter folder name to backup: " folder
backup_name="${folder}_$(date +%F).tar.gz"
mkdir -p /tmp/backups

tar -czf /tmp/backups/$backup_name $folder
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup successful: /tmp/backups/$backup_name"
else
    echo "Backup failed!"
fi
```
